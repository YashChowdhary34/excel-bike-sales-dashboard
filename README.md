## Dataset Overview
**Worksheet: bike_buyers**

The dataset contains information about potential bike buyers, including:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, marital status, income, and region.
- **Lifestyle Factors**: Occupation, homeownership status, and commute distance.
- **Purchase Behavior**: Whether the customer purchased a bike.

This raw data serves as the foundation for subsequent analysis.

## Cleaned and Feature-Engineered Data
**Worksheet: Working Sheet**

This sheet contains data that has been cleaned and enriched to enhance analysis:
- **Data Cleaning**: Standardized formatting (e.g., consistent labels for distances and marital status).
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Created an "Age Brackets" column categorizing individuals into groups like "Middle Age" and "Senior."
  - Improved gender representation (e.g., converting "F" to "Female" and "M" to "Male").

This structured data enables deeper exploration and precise insights.

## Pivot Table Analysis
**Worksheet: Pivot Table**

The pivot table aggregates and summarizes the dataset, focusing on:
- Average income of customers by gender and purchase status.
- Total bike purchases segmented by demographic categories.
- Key metrics like purchase rates and overall counts.

These summaries guide the design of visual insights in the dashboard.

## Dashboard Visualization
**Worksheet: Dashboard**

The dashboard consolidates all analyses into an interactive and visually engaging format, highlighting:
- Bike purchase trends across demographics.
- Key performance metrics, such as total sales and purchase rates.
- Visual elements like bar charts, pie charts, and tables to present the data intuitively.

This dashboard provides stakeholders with actionable insights at a glance.

## Future Work
- **Advanced Analysis**: Incorporating predictive modeling to identify potential buyers.
- **Dynamic Dashboards**: Enhancing interactivity with advanced tools like Power BI or Tableau.
- **Integration**: Connecting the dashboard to live data sources for real-time insights.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the power of structured data analysis and visualization in uncovering trends and driving decision-making. By progressing through raw data, feature engineering, and pivot table summaries, we created a dashboard that simplifies complex data for actionable insights.
